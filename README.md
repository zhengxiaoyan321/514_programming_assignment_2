Functions for preprocessing are implemented in preprocessing.py, including one function for binary classification problem and one for multi-class classification problem. Functions for k-nearest neighbor classifier are implemented in kNN.py, including functions for training, cross validation, and dimension reduction. Functions for decision tree classifier are implemented in decisionTree.py, including functions for training, cross validation, and dimension reduction. All functions have dependency on sklearn.

Examples of using the functions and actual results of training and testing the models can be found in main.ipynb.
